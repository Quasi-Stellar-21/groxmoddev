  grox_gigagun:0 "Novian Microsingularity Bombard"
  grox_gigagun_desc:0 "The mainline armament on Novian warships, this weapon compresses a carefully measured mass of charged particles into a short-lived microscopic black hole which is then magnetically accelerated to relativistic speeds to detonate precisely on impact with enemy ships."
  
  grox_laser:0 "Novian USM Field Projector"
  grox_laser_desc:0 "A Novian weapon which exploits electrodynamic properties of charged strangelets to produce a cataclysmically strong linear magnetic field, capable of tearing most exposed physical matter asunder."
  
  grox_barrage_of_death:0 "The Barrage of Death"
  grox_barrage_of_death_desc:0 "This gigantic weapons array batters at enemy ships, fortifications, and anything else the Grox want to destroy to esnure that death is delivered quickly, efficently, and brutally.  Do not point at self."
  
  grox_the_missile:0 "Novian Missile"
  grox_the_missile_desc:0 "The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't.  In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was.  The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error."
  
  grox_fighter:0 "Novian Voidbird"
  grox_fighter_desc:0 "These deceptively small Novian craft employ intra-system Alcubierre drives to deliver brutally quick strikes against enemy vessels."
  
  grox_hyperdrive:0 "Alerium Drive"
  grox_hyperdrive_desc:0 "Originally designed by Huaki Alerious, the Novian High Engineer of Majesty, this is one of the fastest FTL methods in the universe.  The Grox employ it to ensure speedy transport across a single galaxy."

  grox_hypership_lance:0 "Quasaric Absolution"
  grox_hypership_lance_desc:0 "The ultimate symbol of Novian bloodlust, a weapon channeling the spacetime-sundering quantum forces around singularities into a macro-scale beam of apocalyptic annihilation."
